1. Overall Flow & User Journey
Build a step-by-step “wizard” form that guides homeowners through each stage.
Keep the language simple, reassuring, and user-friendly.
Emphasize visual choices over technical details.
Present a running summary or “Your System So Far” to show progress and personalization.

2. House & Roof Information
Questions about construction: Offer dropdowns (e.g., newbuild, modern, pre-2000) and let users pick.
Exterior colors & materials: Allow selection from typical options (brick, stone, cladding, etc.), plus a free-form field for “Other.”
Roof details:
Ask about tile type (slate, clay, etc.)
Color (black, red, grey, other)
Roof style (sloping/flat)
Compass direction of main roof panels (prompt them to use a phone’s compass).
House type: (terraced, semi-detached, detached) – show images if possible.
Roof dimensions: Provide two methods:
Exact (if user has plans).
Approximate (if user can measure or estimate).

3. Photo Upload & Visualization
Create an upload function for front, rear, right side, and left side images.
Include simple instructions on how to edit photos (draw a cable route, highlight areas).
Ensure the user can doodle or mark the image with minimal friction—no advanced graphics tools needed, just basic line drawing.

4. Cable Routing & Aesthetics
Ask user to choose cable color (white, dark red, black, grey).
Prompt user to select the least visually intrusive path for the cable (use positive language, e.g., “best visual path” or “most discreet path” instead of “least ugly”).
Let them mark the cable route on their uploaded photo or indicate it via a quick sketch/drawing tool.

5. Energy Consumption & Household Details
Include a simple question about how many people live in the home.
Prompt them for monthly/annual electricity usage (from their bill or an online account).
If feasible, add direct links or buttons to popular utility sites to encourage easy data retrieval.
Show a checklist of standard appliances (e.g., oven, fridge, washer, dryer, WiFi router, etc.) and let users add additional devices (e.g., electric vehicle).

6. Battery Capacity Choice
Offer a straightforward selection process (e.g., 10kWh or 15kWh).
Reassure them that bigger capacity covers future needs (electric vehicle, more appliances).
Mention potential to sell surplus energy back to the grid if current usage is low.

7. Output: Recommended System & Online Purchase/Reservation
After the questionnaire, generate a personalized list of recommended products (solar panels, tiles, wall panels, battery).
Provide clear “Buy Now” or “Reserve” options for each item.
Include a summary page so users can review all details before checkout/reservation.

8. User Comfort & Reassurance
Throughout, use friendly text and visuals to emphasize simplicity and easy decision-making.
Defer complex, technical questions to later stages or hide them under “Advanced Options” so casual users aren’t overwhelmed.

9. Technical Notes for Developer
Use a responsive design that works well on mobile (since users might take photos on phones).
Incorporate basic image-editing or annotation functionality.
Possibly use interactive visual elements (compass direction, clickable house diagrams) for a more engaging experience.
Store all user inputs in a structured format for further processing (e.g., database or form submission handling).
Consider an option to save progress and continue later, so users aren’t forced to finish in one go.

Key Takeaway:
Make the homeowner feel they’re personally customizing a simple, visually appealing solar energy system. Keep steps clear, image-friendly, and low on technical jargon. Provide a final product list they can purchase or reserve online.
